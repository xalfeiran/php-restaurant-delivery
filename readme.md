<h1>Delivery App for Newbies</h1>
<p>Well this was a kind of quiz project for a Job, it's a quick app that emulates a restaurant delivery app, where you can go as costumer, see the menu and order, it's writen ins PHP with Codeigniter 3, HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
<strong>Enjoy you PHP newbies!</strong>
<h4>Install Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Web Server with PHP 7.x</li>
<li>MySQL or MariaDB</li>
</ul>

<h4>Config</h4>
<p>Once the project is in a public folder, edit the following files:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Create the database with the provided script</li>
<li>applications/config/database.php and enter the db credentials</li>
<li>.htaccess  Enter the public folder for the app</li>
<li>Maybe a SSL Certificate would be nice</li>
</ul>

<h4>That is it</h4>

<h4>P.S.</h4>
<p>I know it's not pure Javascript or something Js based, but is a full working app from Host + DB + Server + Client <br/>
   I hope you liked it</p>
